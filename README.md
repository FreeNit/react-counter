# React-counter

## Used in project:

- useEffect -> simulate component life-cycle methods
- useState -> creates internal Component data (built-in state object)
- memo -> prevents function execution that is triggered by parent component. It wraps around Component-function. Compares prop values (old prop Value and new prop Value)
- useMemo -> wraps around normal functions that are executed in Component-function to prevent their unnecessary execution
- useCallback -> used for to avoid unnecessary function recreation
- million.js -> improve React performance. Replace React Virtual DOM comparison mechanism with more efficient one.
